<p>So if you're on this page, this probably means you're a marker and marking our website.<br/>If this is the case, there may be a couple of things you are unsure about in how this site works. I will attempt to guide you through things below.</p>

<p>First off, how do I create/edit things?</p>
<ul>
	<li>
	Locations and Companies are pretty straight forward... Though as it stands, we haven't allowed you to remove them, short of url trickery or access to a rails console or the database. Feel free to edit them though.
	</li>
	<li>By the way, if the index page for a resource doesn't provide a link to edit them, you can always do it by going to the show page for that resource (that is with the exception of resources you can't modify.)
	</li>
	<li>
		Route Segments: these can be created by the Route Segments page, on the create new segment link at the bottom of the list. 
	</li>
	<li>
		Margins. These are actually autogenerated on first use, and preloaded with default margins depending on the priority. You can set your own manual margins by using the form on the index page for Route Margins by selecting the route you want to modify the margin for. If you don't do this before sending a request on that route, it'll use the default margin for that priority to generate that request's price.  
	</li>
	<li>
		Requests are fairly straight forward, you can create on the Mail Request page, at the bottom of the lists with the new request link. So long as you fill in all the details, and there is a route between the two locations, it will be created for you. The price is generated from the cost * the margin for that route
	</li>
</ul>
<p>Explanations:</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		Route Segment. Ok so the lingo here is that route segment is a pretty much any route a company offers for shipping. One or more of these combine to give you the route your mail requests will go on. An example would be with two ends: Wellington and Auckland. They also have an associated priority, so you could have the above segment in either air, sea or land as three different segments. If you were sending something from Wellington to Rome in a request, there probably wouldn't be a direct segment between. It'd be split up into segments Wellington and Auckland, and then Auckland and Rome (that's pretty far actually).
	</li>
	<li>
		Route (as opposed to route segment) is a trio of to location, from location and priority, which every request has. This is different to segments in that a route can be made up of one or more segments to get from one location to the other.
	</li>
	<li>
		The margin is used to calculate the price. It does this by multiplying itself by the cost of each segment, which is calculated by getting the greater of cost per weight times weight or cost per volume times volume. The request price is the sum of all the prices of all it's segments prices.
	</li>
</ul>
<p>Where are the figures and events?:</p>
<ol>
	<li>
		So the current figures are obviously in the figures page.
	</li>
	<li>
		There is a link to the event page in the figures page
	</li>
	<li>
		You can look at the event details by clicking the details link for that event
	</li>
	<li>
		The figures at the time that event was created is accessible by link on that detail page for that event
	</li>
	<li>
		That's all actually... Maybe I didn't need to explain it.
	</li>
</ol>
